# Command-Line Interface (CLI) Design

Welcome to the Command-Line Interface (CLI) Design repository! This project is an exploration of frontend development, inspired by the charming and functional design of command prompts.

## Overview

The CLI Design project recreates a command-line shell experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a blend of classic terminal aesthetics with modern features, providing an immersive and interactive environment.

## Features

- **Directory Structure**: Navigate through a nested directory structure, unveiling different facets of the virtual environment.
- **Commands**: Execute various commands, including listing directories (`ls`), changing display color (`color`), toggling text animation (`anim`), and more.
- **Interactive Elements**: Enjoy clickable links, dynamic text animations, and sound effects for an engaging experience.

## File Structure

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file defining the structure of the CLI.
- **`style.css`**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) file styling the CLI interface.
- **`script.js`**: JavaScript file handling dynamic behavior, command processing, and user interactions.
- **`files` Directory**: Contains simulated files and directories for the virtual environment.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahilwep/CLI_Design.git
   ```

2. Use any server to host these file content on your local machine:
   1. Python way:
      1. visit inside the directory.
      2. open shell 
      3. use command `python3 -m http.server 80`
      4. open `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` on your browser.
   2. VsCode way:
      1. use `liveserver` extension.

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to experience the CLI.

4. Interact with the shell using various commands and explore the virtual environment.

## Commands

- **`ls`**: List directories.
- **`help`**: Display command descriptions and usages.
- **`clear`**: Clear the screen.
- **`color #hexcode`**: Change display color.
- **`anim`**: Toggle text animation.
- **`sound`**: Mute/Unmute sound effects.
- **`cd`**: Go to the root directory.

## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from [Name of the Inspirational Project]. Their innovative approach motivated the creation of this CLI Design.
